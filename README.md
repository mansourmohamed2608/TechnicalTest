Technical Test Documentation for Backend Development with Node.js and Express.js
Introduction

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the development process for creating a simple Express.js server and a RESTful API endpoint as part of the technical assessment for the Senior Full Stack Developer position. 
It includes detailed steps, methodologies, and best practices employed to achieve the objectives efficiently and effectively.
Environment Setup
Prerequisites

    1. Node.js (v14.17.0 or higher)
    2. npm (v6.14.13 or higher)
    3. Postman (for testing endpoints)
    4. Visual Studio Code (or any preferred IDE)

Project Initialization

    1. Creating the Project Directory: Created a directory named telemed-backend-test and initialized it with npm init -y to create a default package.json file.
    2. Express.js Installation: Installed Express.js using npm install express to handle HTTP requests and routing.

Task Implementation
Task 1: Simple Express.js Server
Objective:

To develop a minimalistic server that returns a "Hello, World!" message to any GET request on the root path.
Development Steps:

    1. Server Setup: Created a file named server.js and imported Express.js to set up a basic server listening on port 3000.
    2. Route Configuration: Defined a GET route for the root (/) path to respond with "Hello, World!".
    
Testing and Validation:

Used Postman to send a GET request to http://localhost:3000 and verified the response was "Hello, World!". Additionally, ensured the server correctly handles non-root routes by returning 404 status codes.

Task 2: RESTful API Endpoint /patients
Objective

To implement an API endpoint that returns a predefined list of patient data in JSON format, demonstrating understanding of REST principles.
Development Steps

    1. Data Preparation: Created a mock dataset of patients to simulate fetching data from a database.
    2. Endpoint Creation: Added a new route /patients to return the patient data as JSON.
Testing and Validation

Performed thorough testing with Postman by accessing the endpoint http://localhost:3000/patients and validated the JSON structure and HTTP status codes.
Challenges Encountered and Solutions

    1. Challenge: Ensuring API scalability for future enhancements.
        Solution: Designed the code structure and routes with modularity and scalability in mind, allowing for easy addition of new endpoints and modification of existing ones.

    2. Challenge: Maintaining code readability and simplicity.
        Solution: Adopted clear naming conventions, modular design, and extensive commenting to enhance code readability and maintainability.

Conclusion

The completion of these tasks demonstrated proficiency in setting up a Node.js environment, creating a basic server with Express.js, and developing RESTful API endpoints. The process underscored the importance of clear planning, effective problem-solving, and adherence to best practices in software development. This exercise provided valuable insights into the practical application of Node.js and Express.js in backend development, particularly in the context of a telemedicine industry focus.
